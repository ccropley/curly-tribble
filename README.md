# Simple API example project
# Because Chuck Norris says so! An on demand Chuck ism only for fun and Restful API exploration

A new updated version of a Simple Flutter API project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple example of consuming a public RestFul API in a Flutter application.

This is a multi-platform application that has been updated to Flutter version 3.19.5. It has been tested as a progressive web application (PWA) and Andriod application. Full support for IoS and desktop is available.

This is fun implementation made possible by the folks at chucknorris.io (https://api.chucknorris.io/). The content is not necessarily politically corret (PC), but no intent to offend anyone is intended. Use at your own risk.
Please enjoy this project as a fun tool and nothing more.
